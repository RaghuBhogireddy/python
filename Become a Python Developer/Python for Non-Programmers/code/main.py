    In this course, Nick teaches the fundamentals of Python to you: a non-programmer, 
    a user with little to no coding experience. Learn more about what Python is, and what it is and 
    isnâ€™t used for. Explore how Python works with numbers and how you can interact with simple programs such 
    as a simple number-guessing game. Find out how to work with text in Python by building a reusable function 
    to count the words in a block of text. And along the way, 
    tackle quick challenges and other games that allow you to put your new skills to the test.
